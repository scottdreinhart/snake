## Architecture

This project enforces nine complementary design principles:

1. **CLEAN Architecture** (Layer Separation)
   - `domain/` layer: Pure, framework-agnostic logic (zero React dependencies)
   - `app/` layer: React hooks for state management & side effects
   - `ui/` layer: Presentational components (atoms → molecules → organisms)
   - **Benefit**: Domain logic is testable, reusable, and framework-independent

2. **Atomic Design** (Component Hierarchy)
   - Data flows unidirectionally: **Hooks → Organism → Molecules → Atoms**
   - Organisms contain zero inline markup; all composition happens in JSX
   - **Benefit**: Components are predictable, composable, and reusable across contexts

3. **SOLID Principles** (Code-Level Design)
   - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
   - **Benefit**: Code is maintainable, testable, and resistant to side effects

4. **DRY Principle** (No Duplication)
   - Constants extracted to single sources; reusable hooks eliminate component duplication
   - **Benefit**: Changes propagate consistently; less code to maintain

5. **Import Boundary Enforcement** (`eslint-plugin-boundaries`)
   - `domain/` → may only import from `domain/` (zero framework deps)
   - `app/` → may import `domain/` + `app/` (never `ui/`)
   - `ui/` → may import `domain/`, `app/`, and `ui/` (full downstream access)
   - `workers/` → may only import `domain/` (pure computation)
   - `themes/` → may not import anything (pure CSS data)
   - **Benefit**: CLEAN layer violations are caught at lint time, not at code review

6. **Path Aliases** (`@/domain`, `@/app`, `@/ui`)
   - Configured in `tsconfig.json` (`paths`) and `vite.config.js` (`resolve.alias`)
   - Eliminates fragile `../../` relative imports across layers
   - **Benefit**: Imports are self-documenting (`@/domain/rules` vs `../../domain/rules`) and resilient to file moves

7. **Barrel Exports** (`index.ts` per directory)
   - Each layer exposes a single public API via its barrel file
   - Internal module structure can change without breaking consumers
   - **Benefit**: Explicit public APIs; refactoring internals doesn't cascade import changes

8. **React Error Boundaries** (Crash Isolation)
   - `ErrorBoundary` component wraps the game at the organism level
   - Catches render errors and displays a themed fallback UI with a retry button
   - Prevents a single component crash from taking down the entire app
   - **Benefit**: Graceful degradation — users see an actionable error, not a white screen

9. **React Context for Dependency Injection** (ThemeProvider + SoundProvider)
   - `ThemeProvider` provides theme state to the entire tree via React Context
   - `SoundProvider` provides sound state + guarded play functions via React Context
   - Both wired at the root in `index.tsx`: `ThemeProvider > SoundProvider > ErrorBoundary > App`
   - **Benefit**: Any component can access theme or sound state without prop drilling

- [ ] **Theme system** — multiple color themes with light/dark/system mode + colorblind presets
- [ ] **Sound effects** — Web Audio API synthesized SFX + background music

### Code Quality

# Individual tools
pnpm lint           # ESLint — check for issues
pnpm lint:fix       # ESLint — auto-fix issues
pnpm format         # Prettier — format all source files

pnpm fix            # lint:fix + format in one pass (auto-fix everything)
pnpm validate       # check + build — full pre-push validation
```
## Future Improvements

The following monetization and sustainability strategies are under consideration. Each model is designed to preserve the free-to-play core experience while introducing optional revenue streams that fund ongoing development, server infrastructure, and cross-platform maintenance.

### Ad Network Participation

- [ ] **Rewarded video ads** — opt-in ad placements (e.g., Google AdMob, Unity Ads) that grant in-game rewards such as bonus theme previews, temporary cosmetic unlocks, or series score multipliers. Users are never forced to watch — ads are triggered only by explicit interaction ("Watch to unlock").
- [ ] **Interstitial placement** — non-intrusive full-screen ads shown at natural breakpoints (between matches, after a game-over screen) with frequency capping to prevent fatigue. Configurable via remote config so cadence can be tuned post-launch without a client update.
- [ ] **Banner integration** — reserved layout slot for lightweight banner ads on non-gameplay screens (settings, stats dashboard). The game board itself remains permanently ad-free to protect the core UX.

> **Justification:** Ad networks provide a zero-barrier revenue floor — every user contributes regardless of purchase intent. Rewarded ads in particular have shown 2–4× higher eCPMs than banners while maintaining positive user sentiment because the value exchange is transparent and voluntary.

### Monthly Subscription

- [ ] **Premium tier** — a low-cost monthly subscription (~$1.99–$3.99/month) that removes all ads, unlocks the full theme catalog, grants early access to new game modes, and provides subscriber-exclusive cosmetics (animated marks, board skins, victory effects).
- [ ] **Cross-project entitlement** — a single subscription covers all games in the portfolio (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Mancala, etc.), increasing perceived value and reducing churn as new titles launch.
- [ ] **Family sharing** — support platform family-sharing mechanisms (Google Play Family Library, Apple Family Sharing) to extend a single subscription across household devices.

> **Justification:** Subscriptions generate predictable, recurring revenue that smooths the volatility of ad markets and one-time purchases. Bundling across the full game portfolio transforms each new title from a separate acquisition cost into a retention tool — subscribers stay engaged as long as fresh content ships.

### Tiered Purchase Model

- [ ] **Free tier** — the complete game with default theme, all difficulty levels, and standard game modes. No gameplay is gated behind a paywall.
- [ ] **Starter pack** (~$0.99) — a one-time purchase that permanently removes banner ads and unlocks 3 additional themes.
- [ ] **Pro pack** (~$2.99) — includes everything in Starter plus all current and future themes, animated marks, custom board textures, and detailed lifetime statistics.
- [ ] **Collector's edition** (~$4.99) — includes everything in Pro plus exclusive seasonal themes, priority access to beta features, and a supporter badge displayed in online multiplayer.

> **Justification:** Tiered pricing captures value across the entire willingness-to-pay spectrum. The free tier maximizes install base and ad impressions; the Starter pack converts casual players at an impulse-buy price point; Pro and Collector's editions extract premium value from engaged users who want completionism and exclusivity. No tier restricts core gameplay — every purchase is cosmetic or convenience-oriented.

### eGoods Purchasing (Themes & Cosmetics)

- [ ] **Individual theme packs** (~$0.49–$0.99 each) — purchase single themes à la carte without committing to a bundle. Ideal for users who want one specific aesthetic without buying a full pack.
- [ ] **Seasonal / limited-edition themes** — time-limited theme drops (holiday palettes, collaborations, community-voted designs) that create urgency and collectibility. Retired themes may return in future rotations.
- [ ] **Mark customization** — purchasable game piece variants: neon glow, hand-drawn sketch, pixel art, emoji, or animated SVG styles. Applied per-player, visible to opponents in online multiplayer.
- [ ] **Board skins** — alternative board grid styles (chalk on slate, wooden inlay, sci-fi hologram, retro arcade) that overlay the default grid lines and cell backgrounds.
- [ ] **Victory effects** — premium win-line and celebration animations (fireworks, sparkle cascade, lightning strike) triggered on game-winning moves.
- [ ] **Sound packs** — alternative synthesized SFX suites (retro 8-bit, orchestral, lo-fi) that replace the default Web Audio API sound set.

> **Justification:** Microtransaction-based eGoods leverage the existing theme architecture — the CSS variable system, lazy-loaded theme chunks, and `useTheme` context already support hot-swapping visual styles at runtime. This makes the marginal engineering cost of each new theme near zero while the perceived user value remains high. Cosmetic-only purchases avoid pay-to-win dynamics and align with platform store guidelines (Apple App Store, Google Play) that discourage gameplay-gating IAPs.
