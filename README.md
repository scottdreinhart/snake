```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v24+ (pin via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) — see `.nvmrc`)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10+

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (accessible on LAN via 0.0.0.0)
pnpm start          # quick alias — vite --host
pnpm dev            # same + kills stale port 5173 first

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build locally
pnpm preview

# Build then preview in one step
pnpm build:preview
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Individual tools
pnpm lint           # ESLint — check for issues
pnpm lint:fix       # ESLint — auto-fix issues
pnpm format         # Prettier — format all source files
pnpm format:check   # Prettier — check formatting without writing
pnpm typecheck      # TypeScript type check (tsc --noEmit)

# Chains
pnpm check          # lint + format:check + typecheck in one pass (quality gate)
pnpm fix            # lint:fix + format in one pass (auto-fix everything)
pnpm validate       # check + build — full pre-push validation
```

### Cleanup & Maintenance

```bash
# Clean
pnpm clean          # wipe dist/ and release/ build outputs
pnpm clean:node     # delete node_modules only
pnpm clean:all      # nuclear — dist/ + release/ + node_modules/

# Fresh start
pnpm reinstall      # clean:all + pnpm install
```

### Electron Desktop App

```bash
# Development: launches Vite + Electron together
pnpm electron:dev

# Preview production build in Electron (build + launch)
pnpm electron:preview

# Production build: creates distributable for current platform in release/
pnpm electron:build

# Platform-specific builds
pnpm electron:build:win     # Windows .exe
pnpm electron:build:linux   # Linux .AppImage
pnpm electron:build:mac     # macOS .dmg
```

Electron wraps the same web app in a native desktop window. In dev mode it connects to the Vite dev server (`localhost:5173`); in production it loads the built `dist/` files directly.

### Capacitor Mobile App

```bash
# Initialize native platforms (one-time setup)
pnpm cap:init:android       # Add Android project
pnpm cap:init:ios            # Add iOS project

# Build web app + sync to native projects
pnpm cap:sync

# Open native IDE
pnpm cap:open:android        # Open in Android Studio
pnpm cap:open:ios            # Open in Xcode

# Run on connected device/emulator
pnpm cap:run:android         # Deploy to Android device
pnpm cap:run:ios             # Deploy to iOS device
```

Capacitor wraps the same Vite `dist/` output in native Android and iOS app shells. The web code runs in a native WebView — no code changes needed.

## Architecture

This project enforces nine complementary design principles:

1. **CLEAN Architecture** (Layer Separation)
   - `domain/` layer: Pure, framework-agnostic logic (zero React dependencies)
   - `app/` layer: React hooks for state management & side effects
   - `ui/` layer: Presentational components (atoms → molecules → organisms)
   - **Benefit**: Domain logic is testable, reusable, and framework-independent

2. **Atomic Design** (Component Hierarchy)
   - Data flows unidirectionally: **Hooks → Organism → Molecules → Atoms**
   - Organisms contain zero inline markup; all composition happens in JSX
   - **Benefit**: Components are predictable, composable, and reusable across contexts

3. **SOLID Principles** (Code-Level Design)
   - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
   - **Benefit**: Code is maintainable, testable, and resistant to side effects

4. **DRY Principle** (No Duplication)
   - Constants extracted to single sources; reusable hooks eliminate component duplication
   - **Benefit**: Changes propagate consistently; less code to maintain

5. **Import Boundary Enforcement** (`eslint-plugin-boundaries`)
   - `domain/` → may only import from `domain/` (zero framework deps)
   - `app/` → may import `domain/` + `app/` (never `ui/`)
   - `ui/` → may import `domain/`, `app/`, and `ui/` (full downstream access)
   - `workers/` → may only import `domain/` (pure computation)
   - `themes/` → may not import anything (pure CSS data)
   - **Benefit**: CLEAN layer violations are caught at lint time, not at code review

6. **Path Aliases** (`@/domain`, `@/app`, `@/ui`)
   - Configured in `tsconfig.json` (`paths`) and `vite.config.js` (`resolve.alias`)
   - Eliminates fragile `../../` relative imports across layers
   - **Benefit**: Imports are self-documenting (`@/domain/rules` vs `../../domain/rules`) and resilient to file moves

7. **Barrel Exports** (`index.ts` per directory)
   - Each layer exposes a single public API via its barrel file
   - Internal module structure can change without breaking consumers
   - **Benefit**: Explicit public APIs; refactoring internals doesn't cascade import changes

8. **React Error Boundaries** (Crash Isolation)
   - `ErrorBoundary` component wraps the game at the organism level
   - Catches render errors and displays a themed fallback UI with a retry button
   - Prevents a single component crash from taking down the entire app
   - **Benefit**: Graceful degradation — users see an actionable error, not a white screen

9. **React Context for Dependency Injection** (ThemeProvider + SoundProvider)
   - `ThemeProvider` provides theme state to the entire tree via React Context
   - `SoundProvider` provides sound state + guarded play functions via React Context
   - Both wired at the root in `index.tsx`: `ThemeProvider > SoundProvider > ErrorBoundary > App`
   - **Benefit**: Any component can access theme or sound state without prop drilling

## Remaining Work

### Visual & UX

- [ ] **Game UI implementation** — build the complete game interface with animations and effects
- [ ] **Theme system** — multiple color themes with light/dark/system mode + colorblind presets
- [ ] **Sound effects** — Web Audio API synthesized SFX + background music

### Code Quality & Testing

- [ ] **Unit tests** — domain functions are pure and test-ready; add Vitest or Jest suite
- [ ] **Component tests** — React Testing Library tests for UI components
- [ ] **Integration / E2E tests** — Playwright or Cypress for full game-flow verification

### DevOps & Deployment

- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow for lint → test → build → deploy
- [ ] **GitHub Pages / Vercel deploy** — auto-deploy `dist/` on push to `main`
- [ ] **Custom app icons** — generate PNG icons from SVG for Electron builds and mobile

## Future Improvements

The following monetization and sustainability strategies are under consideration. Each model is designed to preserve the free-to-play core experience while introducing optional revenue streams that fund ongoing development, server infrastructure, and cross-platform maintenance.

### Ad Network Participation

- [ ] **Rewarded video ads** — opt-in ad placements (e.g., Google AdMob, Unity Ads) that grant in-game rewards such as bonus theme previews, temporary cosmetic unlocks, or series score multipliers. Users are never forced to watch — ads are triggered only by explicit interaction ("Watch to unlock").
- [ ] **Interstitial placement** — non-intrusive full-screen ads shown at natural breakpoints (between matches, after a game-over screen) with frequency capping to prevent fatigue. Configurable via remote config so cadence can be tuned post-launch without a client update.
- [ ] **Banner integration** — reserved layout slot for lightweight banner ads on non-gameplay screens (settings, stats dashboard). The game board itself remains permanently ad-free to protect the core UX.

> **Justification:** Ad networks provide a zero-barrier revenue floor — every user contributes regardless of purchase intent. Rewarded ads in particular have shown 2–4× higher eCPMs than banners while maintaining positive user sentiment because the value exchange is transparent and voluntary.

### Monthly Subscription

- [ ] **Premium tier** — a low-cost monthly subscription (~$1.99–$3.99/month) that removes all ads, unlocks the full theme catalog, grants early access to new game modes, and provides subscriber-exclusive cosmetics (animated marks, board skins, victory effects).
- [ ] **Cross-project entitlement** — a single subscription covers all games in the portfolio (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Mancala, etc.), increasing perceived value and reducing churn as new titles launch.
- [ ] **Family sharing** — support platform family-sharing mechanisms (Google Play Family Library, Apple Family Sharing) to extend a single subscription across household devices.

> **Justification:** Subscriptions generate predictable, recurring revenue that smooths the volatility of ad markets and one-time purchases. Bundling across the full game portfolio transforms each new title from a separate acquisition cost into a retention tool — subscribers stay engaged as long as fresh content ships.

### Tiered Purchase Model

- [ ] **Free tier** — the complete game with default theme, all difficulty levels, and standard game modes. No gameplay is gated behind a paywall.
- [ ] **Starter pack** (~$0.99) — a one-time purchase that permanently removes banner ads and unlocks 3 additional themes.
- [ ] **Pro pack** (~$2.99) — includes everything in Starter plus all current and future themes, animated marks, custom board textures, and detailed lifetime statistics.
- [ ] **Collector's edition** (~$4.99) — includes everything in Pro plus exclusive seasonal themes, priority access to beta features, and a supporter badge displayed in online multiplayer.

> **Justification:** Tiered pricing captures value across the entire willingness-to-pay spectrum. The free tier maximizes install base and ad impressions; the Starter pack converts casual players at an impulse-buy price point; Pro and Collector's editions extract premium value from engaged users who want completionism and exclusivity. No tier restricts core gameplay — every purchase is cosmetic or convenience-oriented.

### eGoods Purchasing (Themes & Cosmetics)

- [ ] **Individual theme packs** (~$0.49–$0.99 each) — purchase single themes à la carte without committing to a bundle. Ideal for users who want one specific aesthetic without buying a full pack.
- [ ] **Seasonal / limited-edition themes** — time-limited theme drops (holiday palettes, collaborations, community-voted designs) that create urgency and collectibility. Retired themes may return in future rotations.
- [ ] **Mark customization** — purchasable game piece variants: neon glow, hand-drawn sketch, pixel art, emoji, or animated SVG styles. Applied per-player, visible to opponents in online multiplayer.
- [ ] **Board skins** — alternative board grid styles (chalk on slate, wooden inlay, sci-fi hologram, retro arcade) that overlay the default grid lines and cell backgrounds.
- [ ] **Victory effects** — premium win-line and celebration animations (fireworks, sparkle cascade, lightning strike) triggered on game-winning moves.
- [ ] **Sound packs** — alternative synthesized SFX suites (retro 8-bit, orchestral, lo-fi) that replace the default Web Audio API sound set.

> **Justification:** Microtransaction-based eGoods leverage the existing theme architecture — the CSS variable system, lazy-loaded theme chunks, and `useTheme` context already support hot-swapping visual styles at runtime. This makes the marginal engineering cost of each new theme near zero while the perceived user value remains high. Cosmetic-only purchases avoid pay-to-win dynamics and align with platform store guidelines (Apple App Store, Google Play) that discourage gameplay-gating IAPs.
